About the Project

This project was initially based on an architecture developed by justborney. The architectural decisions, core modules, and initial structure were taken as a foundation.

All further improvements, adaptations, and development of additional functionality were carried out by the author under the pseudonym "Nidvig," which is my nickname in this project.

The project includes my own enhancements and new functionality that I added to meet specific requirements and goals.

Thank you for your interest in the project!
